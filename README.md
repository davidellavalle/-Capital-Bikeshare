## Introduction:

The project analysis is based on data pulled from Capital Bikeshare, a company that offers a bicycle sharing system in Washington, D.C.   
The goal of the project is to find interesting paths about the User behaviour and the demand of services in the different seasons and months of the year, as well as day of the week or hours of the day. The data and results will be then used to provide the company with useful and meaningful insights on their business and give KPI's suggestions to measure the business and ensure future growth.  
Finally a prototype App (developed with the Flask framework and deployed by using Heroku) was developed to predict the demand of bike in the different days of the year depending on the day and time of pickup.  
At first we were provided with a dataset containing hourly and daily count of rental bikes along with the weather information for a period of 24 months (2011-12). Gradually more current data (2018-2019, March 2020) was downloaded from the company's website allowing us to focus on the following bulletpoints:

- Contribution of weather condition on bike demands  
- Season wise hourly distribution of bike rentals
- Casual users vs Member users, customer behaviour on usage of bikeshare
- Peaks during time - monthly, weekly, hourly (most requested hour of the days)
- Ride Duration - mean over day
- Most used Dock stations
- The Impact of Covid on bike demand.
